# WorkdayScraper

This is a project that can pull jobs from workday careers pages. I'm hoping to eventually set up a program to update me within a day of jobs at companies I want to work at. 

Feel free to use this! (But also try not to be spammy with requests)

## Requirements
- Required python packages (see requirements.txt)
  - You can install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Be careful, this should probably be done in a venv
- WebDriver. This will be specific to your browser! You can download here: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/
